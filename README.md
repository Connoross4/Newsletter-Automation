# Medium Newsletter Trading Digest Automation

This Python automation tool streamlines the process of turning your Medium (and Beehiiv) newsletter into actionable trading insights. It integrates directly with Gmail, downloads your most recent newsletter emails, extracts article links, fetches the full article content, summarizes the material using an AI summarizer, and stores the results locally for easy recall.

## Key Features

- **Automated Gmail Fetching:**  
  Uses the Gmail API to securely access your inbox and retrieve the latest Medium or Beehiiv newsletters.

- **Article Extraction and Processing:**  
  Parses newsletter HTML to identify article links, then downloads and cleans the full text from each article.

- **AI-Powered Summarization:**  
  Summarizes each article into concise, trading-focused insights using Anthropic's Claude language model (via LangChain).

- **Local Database Storage:**  
  Saves summaries, links, and full content to a SQLite database for efficient caching and future reference.

- **Customizable Workflow:**  
  Designed for easy extension to support different newsletter sources or summary formats.

## Use Case

Traders and analysts can quickly digest daily trading advice from Medium or Beehiiv newsletters without manually opening every email or reading full articles. The summarized content is ready for strategy building, market research, or portfolio adjustments.
